Overview of changes in libqmi 1.12.6
----------------------------------------

Overview of changes in libqmi 1.12.4
----------------------------------------

 * Fix reading last call packet statistics.

 * Added support for the "DMS Set FCC" command, required to bring out of low
   power mode several new Sierra devices.


Overview of changes in libqmi 1.12.2
----------------------------------------

 * Fix bug reading sized-guints, which was making --dms-get-time segfault.

 * Fix compilation warnings in 32 bit systems.

 * Add missing services in get_printable() and get_version_introduced().


Overview of changes in libqmi 1.12.0
----------------------------------------

* New `--enable-qmi-username' option during configure, which allows specifying
  which will be the user owning the /dev/cdc-wdm character devices of all QMI
  modems (udev rules are installed to change file ownership). If this option is
  used, the qmi-proxy will only allow connections from processes running by the
  specified user or by the root user.

* New TLV builder and reader API, which is much more strict and secure. The
  autogenerated code will no longer first check if there is enough space
  available in the output message buffer and then write the parsed contents.
  Instead, the new reader API will be used, which is able to check for the
  expected size directly before writing in the buffer.

* New unit tests to check messages built by the libqmi-glib library, using a
  fake proxy. In order to support these, the QmiDevice has two new properties:
  ** "device-no-file-check": instructs the QmiDevice to avoid checking if the
     specified file exists.
  ** "device-proxy-path": specifies a custom abstract socket path for the
     QmiProxy, to avoid using the default one.

* New A-GPS support in the PDS service:
  ** pds: added "Get Default Tracking Session" request/response
  ** pds: added "Set Default Tracking Session" request/response
  ** pds: added "Get AGPS Config" request/response
  ** pds: added "Set AGPS Config" request/response

* Updated minumum available version of several messages:
  ** dms: "UIM Get IMSI" seems to be available in DMS 1.1 already
  ** dms: "UIM Get ICCID" seems to be available in DMS 1.1 already

* Other bugfixes and minor improvements:
  ** Attach timeout and idle events to the thread-default context.
  ** Fix bashisms in the qmi-network script.
  ** Fix qmi_message_set_transaction_id() in non-CTL messages.
  ** Fix segfault due to race condition in the QmiProxy.
  ** Fixed printing contents of structs with fixed sized strings in qmi-codegen.

Overview of changes in libqmi 1.8.0
